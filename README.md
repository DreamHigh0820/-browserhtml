Browser.html: an experimental Desktop browser, based on Firefox Desktop and Firefox OS. UI is built in HTML.

**Setup**

Serve code via a HTTP server:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Use a recent B2G build:
```
b2g --start-manifest http://localhost:8000/manifest.webapp
```

**The App**

Browser.html is a HTML app (like any B2G app). It is based on the
[Browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_the_Browser_API)
and works the same way Gaia's browser and system apps work.
Even though it includes tags like *vbox*, *hbox*, *spacer*, â€¦, it's all HTML
(see `layout.css` to see how they mimic xul layout).

Current priority is to re-implement the basic features of Firefox Desktop to
make Browser.html a usable browser, and understand what's missing at the
platform level for a perfect integration to the OS.
